# The future of code craftsmanship  is here

Hi! My name is Przemyslaw Regulski, I am proffesional code **artisan** and this is my magnum opus. This repo is not only a source code, it's a piece of art meant to be consumed while laying in the sun on slow summer afternoon or in front of cozy fireplace with loved one in your embrace on cold winter evenings. But before we dive into the strings with which I weaved this masterpiece let me tell you a strory.


# A story

When I was 9 I noticed my father crying. He was a strong man. He never let his guard down and practiced deep emotional smothering. But this day was different, for the first time I saw him being vulnerable, like a wounded gazelle he was sitting there at the mercy of his own feelings. I approached him slowly fearing of what was the cause of such breakdown. As I came closer I saw glimpse of what was he so overwhelmed with and I understood. I recently had created github and he was looking at my first pull request. It was my first painting, drawn on the canvas of github. "How's it called?" He asked through tears. 
"The first commit" I replied.
And god wept.

## Viaven

If you think about civilization progress as a sinusoid here is were we meet out turning point. Viaven brings the peak of XXI century. This repo represents highpoint of both efficiency and artistic value. It's all downhill from here on.
## Why not SignalR?
Failure of imagination is what causes societies to fall. Edmund Hillar once said:
``"It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves."``

## Endpoints
On port ``2000`` you can meet your destiny with following classes after serialization
```Java
class JsonPackage
{
	public String Type;
	public Object Content;
}
```
